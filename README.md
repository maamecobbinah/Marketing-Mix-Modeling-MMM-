# Problem Statement
Haven Home Living is a hypothetical home living company trying to understand which marketing channels truly drive sales. 
With budgets spread across digital (social, search, email) and traditional (radio, flyers, partnerships) platforms, it’s difficult to isolate which channels contribute most efficiently to revenue growth.
It wants to answer key business questions such as:
1. How much revenue does each marketing channel drive?
2. What is the optimal spend allocation across channels to maximize ROI?
3. How do external factors (holidays, pricing, promotions, and distribution) impact sales performance?
To address these, this project applies Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) — a statistical approach that quantifies the impact of different marketing activities and external variables on sales outcomes.
# Approach
### Data Generation & Preparation
1. Created a synthetic but realistic dataset for Haven Home Living, modeled after a mid-sized retailer.
2. 6 months of daily data (January–June 2024) across multiple marketing and operational variables.
### Feature Engineering
1. Encoded holiday and event effects (e.g., Family Day, Easter, Mother’s Day).
2. Adjusted for product availability, price fluctuations, and promotion intensity.
### Modeling Techniques
### Insights & Visualization
1. Channel ROI comparison (revenue per $1 of spend).
2. Simulated optimal budget allocation scenarios.
3. Identified key seasonal uplift moments (e.g., Easter, Mother’s Day).
