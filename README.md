# Problem Statement
Haven Home Living is a hypothetical home living company trying to understand which marketing channels truly drive sales. 
With budgets spread across digital (social, search, email) and traditional (radio, flyers, partnerships) platforms, it’s difficult to isolate which channels contribute most efficiently to revenue growth.
It wants to answer key business questions such as:
1. How much revenue does each marketing channel drive?
2. What is the optimal spend allocation across channels to maximize ROI?
3. How do external factors (holidays, pricing, promotions, and distribution) impact sales performance?
To address these, this project applies Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) — a statistical approach that quantifies the impact of different marketing activities and external variables on sales outcomes.
